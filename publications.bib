  title={Pseudo-likelihood produces associative memories able to generalize, even for asymmetric couplings},
  author={D'Amico, Francesco and Bocchi, Dario and Del Bono, Luca Maria and Rossi, Saverio and Negri, Matteo},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.05147},
  year={2025},
  annote={We studied pseudo-likelihood training in an analitically tractable model. We show why it behaves as an associative memory and that during training time it interpolates between already known learning rules. We show that such model is capable of generalization and that it works even if couplings are not symmetric.}

  author={D'Amico, Francesco and Bocchi, Dario and Negri, Matteo},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2505.13230},
  year={2025},
  annote={We show with a simple Perceptron theory how the norm of a model can be used as a useful parameter to predict its scaling laws. We show with extensive simulations that also deep-networks in real datasets classification show the same behavior.}

  author={Nicoletti, Flavio and D'Amico, Francesco and Negri, Matteo},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.02586},

  annote={We studied the Vector Hopfield network with Hebb couplings in arbitrary number of dimensions, computing the equilibrium phase diagram and discovering an out-of-equilibrium denoising behaviour absent in standard hopfield model.}
