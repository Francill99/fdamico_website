We show with extensive simulations that also deep-networks in real datasets classification show the same behavior.\n\n\nPseudo-likelihood produces associative memories able to generalize, even for asymmetric couplingsD’Amico, F., Bocchi, D., Del Bono, L. M., Rossi, S., & Negri, M.2025. arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.05147TL;DR: We studied pseudo-likelihood training in an analitically tractable model. We show why it behaves as an associative memory and that during training time it interpolates between already known learning rules. We show that such model is capable of generalization and that it works even if couplings are not symmetric.\n\n\nStatistical mechanics of vector hopfield network near and above saturationNicoletti, F., D’Amico, F., & Negri, M.2025. arXiv preprint arXiv:2507.02586TL;DR: We studied the Vector Hopfield network with Hebb couplings in arbitrary number of dimensions, computing the equilibrium phase diagram and discovering an out-of-equilibrium denoising behaviour absent in standard hopfield model.\n\n\nSelf-attention as an attractor network: Transient memories without backpropagationD’Amico, F., & Negri, M.2024. 2024 IEEE workshop on complexity in engineering (COMPENG), 1–6TL;DR: We show that a simplified self-attention model trained directly via pseudo-likelihood minimization behaves as an associative memory at the very first step of dynamics."
