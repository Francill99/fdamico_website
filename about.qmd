# About

Hello! I am **Francesco Dâ€™Amico**, a PhD student in Physics at **Sapienza University of Rome**, where I work under the supervision of Matteo Negri and Chiara Cammarota.  
My research lies at the intersection of **statistical mechanics, machine learning, and complex systems**, with a focus on how ideas from physics can illuminate modern AI and vice versa.
